# Canada-Digital-Economic
 Using data visualization, modeling analysis, text analysis to gain deeper understanding about Canada's digital economic.
 Language: Python

## Introduction:
Canada's policy orientation in the digital economy is combined with time- and industry-specific information to facilitate the development of the digital economy. The government has adopted a range of policy initiatives, including innovation and technology strategies, digital infrastructure investments, data privacy and security protection, entrepreneurial support and innovation ecosystems, digital skills training and talent development, to meet the needs of different time periods and industries. These policies aim to establish an innovative digital economy system by providing support such as financial support, infrastructure development and regulatory development to promote the application and development of digital economy in different industries. In addition, the government is focusing on developing digital skills and talent to meet the demand for digitally competent individuals in different industries. Through the integration of these policies, Canada is committed to take a leading position in the global digital economy competition and to drive the growth and innovation of the digital economy across different industries.

Most of our datasets were downloaded from Statistics Canada. In addition to this, we also refer to Statistic, a comprehensive statistical resource website that brings together statistics and indicators from a variety of fields, including economic, demographic, social, environmental, and many others.

### RQ1: Internet Usage in Canada

Reason: A focus on Internet use in Canada is critical to the study of the digital economy. Understanding the level of engagement and consumer behavior of Canadians in online shopping, digital payments and social media can help identify market needs and business opportunities, and assess the digital infrastructure and digital inclusion landscape.

### RQ2: Predict who will be vulnerable to cyber security attacks.

Reason: The dangers of data hacking and cyberattacks are a growing concern for individuals and businesses nowadays. The challenge of dealing with such attacks is that it is difficult to predict who will be attacked. However, this hurdle can be overcome by using machine learning techniques to develop models that can identify objects most likely to be attacked. The goal of the project is to build machine learning models that can be used to predict which individuals are more vulnerable to cyberattacks in Canada. These models are constructed using appropriate data sources and scored against metrics relevant to determining their ability to identify potential cybercrime victims. Lessons learned from this project can be used to develop effective cybersecurity policies and programs that promote digital security for Canadian businesses and individuals.

### RQ3: Text analysis of reports related to Canadaâ€™s digital economy.

Reason 1: Understanding the Landscape

The text of the analysis helps provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of Canada's digital economy. It provides insight into the key issues, challenges, and opportunities associated with digital transformation across all sectors.

Reason 2: Policy development

The text analysis helps policymakers and regulators develop effective policies and regulations. By analyzing these reports, policymakers can identify trends, gaps, and areas that need attention to promote innovation, competition, and economic growth in the digital economy.

Reason 3: Identify key themes and recommendations

Text analysis helps to extract key themes, trends, and recommendations from the reports. It enables policymakers to prioritize areas of focus and develop strategies to address challenges and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the digital economy.
